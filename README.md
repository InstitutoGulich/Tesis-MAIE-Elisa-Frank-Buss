# Tesis-MAIE-Elisa-Frank-Buss

This repository includes the Master Thesis in Spatial Information Applications of Eng. Elisa Frank Buss.

In the Texts folder you can find the thesis manuscript in PDF format.

In the Code folder you can find the R scripts of functions that were used to calculate the Generalised Radar Vegetation Index (GRVI).

In the Data folder you will find a clipping of a quad-pol SAOCOM Single Look Complex (SLC) image that can be used as an example to test the scripts. The clipping made available does not correspond to any of the clippings used in the thesis, because SAOCOM data cannot be shared publicly. Instead, we share a clipping of an image that the institution in charge of distributing SAOCOM data, the Argentine Space Agency (CONAE), made available to the public for this kind of situation. It is necessary to clarify that this repository was created before access policies for SAOCOM images were made more flexible (https://www.argentina.gob.ar/noticias/la-informacion-saocom-cada-vez-mas-accesible).
